      Hi, my full name is Nassouh Kabbani. Below is a short summary of my life
      that tells you who I am and what motivates me. Enjoy!
    </p>
    <div class="summary">
      <ul class="listoflife">
        <li>
          I am half Lebanese half English. So yes, half of me loves good food,
          and the other half doesn't.
        </li>
        <li>
          I grew up in Manchester, where I spent the first 18 years of my life.
          I played football for Manchester United from age 6 to 12 and then I
          was dropped from the team and switched to Manchester City and stayed
          there for 4 years.
        </li>
        <li>
          I am lucky to have 2 great parents and one (great) sister. We've had
          many arguments, most originating from Monopoly. I've now been banned
          from playing Monopoly with my family.
        </li>
        <li>
          I went to a local private school: The Manchester Grammar School. I
          learned a lot there - more on the social side. It made me humbler. I
          usually had to miss 1-2 days of school a week for football, which I
          timed perfectly with art class.
        </li>
        <li>
          I wanted to play professional football, it's what I spent 21 years of
          my life working towards. But I only wanted to pursue it if I was
          playing at the highest level. Deep down I realised it wasn't going to
          happen as soon as I decided to go to college in the U.S.
        </li>
        <li>
          I was recruited by UChicago, who gave me a full scholarship. I tried
          to go to Harvard, but they don't like to recruit good players.
          UChicago turned out to be great - I met some very smart people there.
          Maya Ordonez being one of them.
        </li>
        <li>
          I didn't learn much in class at UChicago. Instead, my learnings came
          from a company I co-founded called Pocketask. The goal was to unite
          the whole gigeconomy into one marketplace. That turned out to be very
          tough.
        </li>
        <li>
          Towards the end of college I became deeply interested in Crypto,
          partly because of the Lebanese banking crisis, and partly because a
          friend I knew was working on something interesting.
        </li>
        <li>
          I think the best way to make money in life is to do so by helping
          other people make money
